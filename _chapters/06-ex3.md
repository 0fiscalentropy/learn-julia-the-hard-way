# Exercise 2: Indexable and associative collections

We have already encountered some collections in the previous chapter – arrays, tuples, dicts and sets. This chapter examines what we can do with collections and how to best use them for maximum effectiveness. 

## Arrays
	Mutable: YES
	Indexed: YES, from 1

Arrays are indexed and, unlike a number of programming languages (such as Python), indices begin with 1, not 0. As we have seen, arrays may be one-dimensional or multidimensional and hold a number of different types.

### Array access

As arrays are indexed, elements can be accessed using the square bracket notation, by their ordinal:

	julia> prime_array = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
	5-element Array{Int64,1}:
	  2
	  3
	  5
	  7
	 11
	 
	julia> prime_array[3]
	5

But how do we access elements in a multidimensional array? Simple – in a multidimensional array, indexes go down each row, then from left to right. Therefore, this array

	julia> md_array = ["A" "B"; "C" "D"]
	2x2 Array{ASCIIString,2}:
	 "A"  "B"
	 "C"  "D"

would be indexed as follows:

	md_array[1] = "A"
	md_array[2] = "C"
	md_array[3] = "B"
	md_array[4] = "D"

This is a little counterintuitive and different from the usual row/column notation, where you would use `array[row][column]`. To retrieve a cell by row and column, use `array[row, column]`:

	julia> md_array[1,2]
	"B"

In Julia, a range of numbers is written as `start:end` or `start:end:steps`. You can use a range to access a range of rows or columns:

	julia> md_array[2,1:2]
	1x2 Array{ASCIIString,2}:
	 "C"  "D"

Alternatively, you can access an entire range by simply leaving one part open:

	julia> md_array[:,1]
	2-element Array{ASCIIString,1}:
	 "A"
	 "C"

You can access the last element of an array using `[end]`:

	julia> md_array[end]
	"D"

### Array manipulation

One of the conventions in Julia is that functions manipulating an object in-place (that is, they alter the object passed to it) are suffixed with `!` (an exclamation mark). This is the case with the array manipulation functions.

#### `push!`, `pop!` and `append!`

`push!` appends the value to the end of the list. `pop!` takes the last element of the list, returns it and removes it from the list.

	julia> array = [1,2,3,4]
	4-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 1
	 2
	 3
	 4
	 
	julia> push!(array, 5)
	5-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 1
	 2
	 3
	 4
	 5
	 
	julia> pop!(array)
	5
	
	julia> array
	4-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 1
	 2
	 3
	 4

`append`, somewhat unusually, puts the elements in an array to the end of your array:

	julia> array2 = [5,6,7]
	3-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 5
	 6
	 7
	 
	julia> append!(array, array2)
	7-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 1
	 2
	 3
	 4
	 5
	 6
	 7

#### `shift!` and `unshift!`

Similarly to `push!`, `shift!` puts elements to the beginning of an array.

## Tuples

	Mutable: NO
	Indexed: YES, from 1

Tuples, as we have learned in the previous chapter, are immutable sequences – their members can be accessed but not changed. Just to be clear about immutability – while you cannot change the tuple itself, there is nothing that keeps you from assigning a different tuple or indeed something else entirely to the variable that used to hold the tuple.

Tuples are also indexed from 1 onwards. The _n_th element is accessed using the square bracket notation:

	julia> primes = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
	(2,3,5,7,11)
	
	julia> primes[2]
	3
