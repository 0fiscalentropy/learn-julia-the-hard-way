# Chapter 9: I/O

Interacting with real world data is where programming gets interesting. Mastering I/O opens up a world of information for your applications and is quite fun, too! With that, let's delve into working with various file types.

## Text files

### Opening and closing files

In general, whenever you open a file, you will eventually need to close it. It's quite crucial to be circumspect with these housekeeping duties, lest you end up with corrupted data!

Julia's way of dealing with files resembles that of Python and a number of other languages. First, using the `open(path)` function, you open a file. The function returns an object that represents the file within Julia, known sometimes as a _file handle_. Commonly, the variable file handles are assigned to is `f`, but this does not have to be the case.

```julia
	f = open("textfile.txt")
```

When you're done with your connection, use the `close()` function to close down the file handle:

```julia
	close(f)
```

### Reading files

Creating a file handle does not actually read the file - it merely checks where it is and figures out how to deal with it. As such, creating your file handle is usually pretty quick and memory-inexpensive, even if the file itself is very large.

However, we want to get something out of the text we imported. For the rest of this chapter, I will be using Virgil's Aeneid to demonstrate text functions, which you can obtain for yourself [here](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/228/pg228.txt) courtesy of Project Gutenberg.

Once I have called the `open` function and assigned the file handle to `f`, I can start reading the file. Julia helpfully offers multiple ways to accomplish this, and it's useful to remember the ability to read a large file line-by-line once we enter the realm of handling large data sets.

#### `readall`

The `readall` function allows you to read the entire file, which it contains in a massive string, with line breaks represented as newlines (`\n`): 

```julia
	julia> readall(f)
