# Exercise 4: Collections

## A taxonomy of collections

We have already encountered some collections in the previous chapter – arrays, tuples, dicts and sets. This chapter examines what we can do with collections and how to best use them for maximum effectiveness. A collection may be _indexable_, _associative_ or neither. This refers primarily to the way we access individual elements within the collection. 

Think of an _indexable_ collection as a shopping list – the only way to identify individual elements is by pointing out their position. If you want to refer to, say, _1 pint of milk_, you refer to it as _the fifth entry on my shopping list_. Elements of an indexable collection are accessed using the square bracket notation `collection[index]`, e.g. `shopping_list[5]`. Unusually for most programming languages and in sharp contrast to other languages like Python, indices begin with 1, rather than 0. An indexable collection is also only equal to a collection with the same elements if they are in the same order – thus `[1, 3, 5, 7] == [3, 7, 1, 5]` yields, as one would expect, `false`.

_Associative_ collections, on the other hand, resemble a page from a phone book instead (if any of you actually still remember what one of those things is!). You wouldn't say that your phone number is on page 217, left column, fifth from the bottom. Rather, you would have a _key_ (your name), by reference to which someone can find your phone number (the _value_). Associative arrays do follow the key-value pair form. They are, therefore, not accessed in the `collection[index]` form but rather in the `collection[key]` form. An associative collection is not indexable, therefore the order of entries does not matter: two associative collections will be equal as long as they contain the same key-value pairs, order regardless.

Collections that are neither associative nor indexable are a somewhat complex case. Sets are the only frequently used collection that is netiher associative nor indexable. They are also special because of the uniqueness constraint, that is, a set may contain each value once and only once. A set does not support the commonly used methods of access, but it does support many of the collection manipulation functions, such as `push!()` and `pop!()`. The latter, in case you were wondering, returns items in a random order, since the absence of an index means sets are not ordered. Sets are not indexable, consequently two sets that contain the same elements will be considered equal, order regardless.

In addition, collections may be _mutable_ or _non-mutable_. Put quite simply, a mutable collection is one where you can change particular values after creation, while in an immutable collection, you cannot do so. The typical immutable collections are, of course, tuples – once you have assigned a value to a tuple, you cannot change that value (although you can assign some other tuple or indeed an entirely different value to the variable that holds the tuple). Sets again represent a special case – they are what could be best described as _pseudo-immutable_ – there is no way to access values in a way that could change them, since you normally access an element of a set by its value (which is sufficient in a set thanks to the uniqueness constraint).


|             |    **Mutable**     |   **Immutable**   |
|:-----------:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|
|  **Indexable**      | Arrays             | Tuples            |
|  **Associative**    | Dicts              |                   |
|  **Non-indexable and non-associative**   |       | Sets      |

## Indexable collections

### Access

Elements of an indexable collection can be accessed using the square bracket notation, by their ordinal:

	julia> prime_array = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
	5-element Array{Int64,1}:
	  2
	  3
	  5
	  7
	 11
	 
	julia> prime_array[3]
	5

In Julia, a range of numbers is written as `start:end` or `start:steps:end`. You can use a range to access a range of elements:

	julia> prime_array[2:3]
	2-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 3
	 5
 
 A range always returns a collection, even if it has the length 1. This is exemplified by the difference between `prime_array[3]`, the call we made above, and `prime_array[3:3]`, which returns
 
	julia> prime_array[3:3]
	1-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 5
	
	julia> prime_array[3:3] == 5
	false

You can access the last element of an indexable collection using `[end]`:

	julia> prime_array[end]
	 11

Incidentally, `end` behaves like a number – so `md_array[end-1]` returns the penultimate element of the collection. 

#### Setting

If the indexable collection you are using is also mutable (e.g. an array), any of these methods will act as a pseudo-variable and will allow you to assign a value to it. Thus `prime_array[end] = 12` would change the last element of `prime_array` to 12. You also aren't restricted to a single element: calling `prime_array[2:4] = 0` would result in

	julia> prime_array
	5-element Array{Int64,1}:
	  2
	  0
	  0
	  0
	 11

And, of course, you can use an array or another indexable collection to replace values:

	julia> prime_array[2:4] = [3,5,7]
	3-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 3
	 5
	 7
	 
	julia> prime_array
	5-element Array{Int64,1}:
	  2
	  3
	  5
	  7
	 11

#### Unpacking

Indexable collections can _unpack_: that is, they can be assigned in a single line to as many distinct variables as they have elements. This is a very useful convenience feature, and is much used in functional programming:

	julia> actors = ["Ian McKellen", "Martin Freeman", "Benedict Cumberbatch"]
	3-element Array{ASCIIString,1}:
	 "Ian McKellen"
	 "Martin Freeman"
	 "Benedict Cumberbatch"
	 
	julia> gandalf, bilbo, frodo = actors
	3-element Array{ASCIIString,1}:
	 "Ian McKellen"
	 "Martin Freeman"
	 "Benedict Cumberbatch"
	 
	julia> gandalf
	"Ian McKellen"

Unpacking can also be used to swap the contents of variables:

	julia> firstname = "Irving"
	julia> lastname = "Washington"
	
	julia> firstname, lastname = lastname, firstname
	("Washington","Irving")
	
	julia> lastname
	"Irving"

### Common functions

#### `push!`, `pop!` and `append!`

`push!` appends the value to the end of the collection. `pop!` takes the last element of the list, returns it and removes it from the collection.

	julia> array = [1,2,3,4]
	4-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 1
	 2
	 3
	 4
	 
	julia> push!(array, 5)
	5-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 1
	 2
	 3
	 4
	 5
	 
	julia> pop!(array)
	5
	
	julia> array
	4-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 1
	 2
	 3
	 4

`append`, somewhat unusually, puts the elements in a collection to the end of the collection:

	julia> array2 = [5,6,7]
	3-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 5
	 6
	 7
	 
	julia> append!(array, array2)
	7-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 1
	 2
	 3
	 4
	 5
	 6
	 7


#### `shift!` and `unshift!`

Similarly to `push!`, `shift!` retrieves the first element of the collection and removes it from the collection, as one would expect looking at the function name:

	julia> shift!(array)
	1

`unshift!` is the front equivalent of `push!`, putting the second argument to the front of the collection:

	julia> unshift!(array, 8)
	7-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 8
	 2
	 3
	 4
	 5
	 6
	 7


#### `find` functions

There's a set of functions starting with find — such as `find()`, `findfirst()`, and `findnext()` — that you can use to get the index or indices of values within an indexable collection that match a specific value, or pass a test. These functions share three properties. 

1. Their result is the _index or indices of the value sought or tested for_, with the _n_th element's index being _n_, not _n-1_ as you might be used to from other languages. 
2. You can use these functions in two principal forms: you can test for a value or you can test for a function, in which case the results will be the values for which the function returns `true`.
3. The `find` functions' way of telling you they haven't found anything is returning zero, since there is no element of index zero.
 
Let's try to find things within the following `Array`: `primes_and_one = [1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23]`

##### `findfirst()`

`findfirst()` finds the first occurrence of a value and returns its index (or zero):

	julia> findfirst(primes_and_one, 5)
	4

As noted above, we can feed the `find` functions a function as well – it will return values for which the function would return a `true` value. We have not really discussed functions, but the general idea should be familiar to you. A function of the form `x -> x == 13` results in `true` of the value of `x` is 13 and `false` otherwise. Let's try to see which prime number is the first to equal 13 (don't expect big surprises):

	julia> findfirst(x -> x == 13, primes_and_one)
	7

You might have noticed that unlike in the case where you were searching for a particular value, _where you're searching by a function, the function comes first_. This is a little idiosyncrasy, but has to do with the way Julia determines what to do based on what it is provided with. A lot more of this will be explored in Chapter [X].

##### `find()`

`find()` returns an array of results. Thus, for instance, let's use the `isinteger` function to see which of our primes are integers (yet again, the result should not come as a shock):

	julia> find(isinteger, primes_and_one)
	10-element Array{Int64,1}:
	  1
	  2
	  3
	  4
	  5
	  6
	  7
	  8
	  9
	 10


##### `findnext()`

`findnext()` returns results from a given index onwards. Thus, if you want to know the index of the first odd number after 3 in the list of primes, you would proceed as follows (using the function `isodd`, which, as you could guess, returns `true` for odd integers and `false` otherwise):

	julia> findnext(isodd, primes_and_one, 4)
	4

Wait, why `4`? As you might remember, Julia is 1-indexed, not 0-indexed. Therefore, an index 'begins before' the number. The number after the first index is the first number in the sequence and so on. As such, the number after the third item in a collection is the item next to (= following) the index `4`, not `3`.

As you might have noticed, when you use a function as an argument, you do not use the parentheses you would normally use to call a function. That is because `function()` means `call this function` while `function` is merely a reference to the function object itself.

##### Get elements, not indices

So far, we've only been getting indices. How do we get the actual elements? The answer is, of course, by using our magical `[]`(square brackets) syntax. We'll also use this as a good opportunity to introduce a very useful function, `isprime()`, which returns `true` for primes and false otherwise:

	julia> find(isprime, primes_and_one)
	9-element Array{Int64,1}:
	  2
	  3
	  4
	  5
	  6
	  7
	  8
	  9
	 10
	 
	julia> primes_and_one[find(isprime,primes_and_one)]
	9-element Array{Int64,1}:
	  2
	  3
	  5
	  7
	 11
	 13
	 17
	 19
	 23


#### Filtering

The `filter()` function works quite similar to `find`, except in this case returns only the elements that satisfy the condition (it is, effectively, a shorthand for the previous listing).

	julia> filter(isodd, primes_and_one)
	9-element Array{Int64,1}:
	  1
	  3
	  5
	  7
	 11
	 13
	 17
	 19
	 23

`filter()` can be used in-place, by using the `!` after the name of the function. Thus, using `filter!()`, alters the actual array rather than returning a filtered copy.


##### Counting

`count()` tells you the number of instances in the collection that satisfy the criterion:

	julia> count(isodd, primes_and_one)
	9

##### `all()` and `any()`

`all()` and `any()` implement two of the mathematical concepts known as _quantifiers_, the universal quantifier \forall 


### Particular types

#### Arrays

##### Access in multidimensional arrays

How do we access elements in a multidimensional array, a special form of indexable collection? Simple – in a multidimensional array, indexes go down each row, then from left to right. Therefore, this array

	julia> md_array = ["A" "B"; "C" "D"]
	2x2 Array{ASCIIString,2}:
	 "A"  "B"
	 "C"  "D"

would be indexed as follows:

	md_array[1] = "A"
	md_array[2] = "C"
	md_array[3] = "B"
	md_array[4] = "D"

This is a little counterintuitive and different from the usual row/column notation, where you would use `array[row][column]`. To retrieve a cell by row and column, use `array[row, column]`:

	julia> md_array[1,2]
	"B"

## Collections and types

Until now, we have generally created collections using literals, and with precious little regard to the types of information that go in them. While types will be discussed in quite a bit of detail later on, what we do know about types is that they are individual categories of data. 

Julia operates what is called _type inference_: unless you tell it explicitly what type something is, it tries to figure it out best as it can. We see this in operation when we create a new collection. When a collection is created and Julia is not told that this is going to be a collection containing elements of only a particular kind or particular kinds of values, it makes an educated guess. The REPL tells us this much:

	julia> mersenne_primes = [3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, 131071]
	6-element Array{Int64,1}:
	      3
	      7
	     31
	    127
	   8191
	 131071

Upon creating the array, the REPL reports to us that it's an array consisting of six elements, all of type `Int64` – a type of signed 64-bit integer (don't worry if that means quite little to you just yet, we will be discussing various integer types in Chapter [X]). It also, helpfully, reports to us that we've got a 1-dimensional array.

### Type inference and dissimilar types

What, however, if I want to play it a little wild and mix it up? Consider the following array:

	 julia> not_really_mersenne_primes = [3, 7, "potato", 127, π, "wallaby"]
	 6-element Array{Any,1}:
	      3
	      7
	       "potato"
	      127
	      π = 3.1415926535897...
	      "wallaby"

As you have guessed, Julia is at a loss as to what to do with this, since we've got a mix of integers, strings and a constant thrown in for good measure. Therefore, it tells us that it has inferred the type of the collection to be `Any` – a type that applies to all objects.

### Type inference and empty collections

The other marginal case is that of the empty set. Julia has a dedicated type, `None` – a subtype of `Any` – that applies to the empty set:

	julia> empty_set = []
	0-element Array{None,1}
