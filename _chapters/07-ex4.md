# Exercise 4: Collections

## A taxonomy of collections

We have already encountered some collections in the previous chapter – arrays, tuples, dicts and sets. This chapter examines what we can do with collections and how to best use them for maximum effectiveness. A collection may be _indexable_, _associative_ or neither. This refers primarily to the way we access individual elements within the collection.

Think of an _indexable_ collection as a shopping list – the only way to identify individual elements is by pointing out their position. If you want to refer to, say, _1 pint of milk_, you refer to it as _the fifth entry on my shopping list_. Elements of an indexable collection are accessed using the square bracket notation `collection[index]`, e.g. `shopping_list[5]`. Unusually for most programming languages and in sharp contrast to other languages like Python, indices begin with 1, rather than 0. An indexable collection is also only equal to a collection with the same elements if they are in the same order – thus `[1, 3, 5, 7] == [3, 7, 1, 5]` yields, as one would expect, `false`.

_Associative_ collections, on the other hand, resemble a page from a phone book instead (if any of you actually still remember what one of those things is!). You wouldn't say that your phone number is on page 217, left column, fifth from the bottom. Rather, you would have a _key_ (your name), by reference to which someone can find your phone number (the _value_). Associative arrays do follow the key-value pair form. They are, therefore, not accessed in the `collection[index]` form but rather in the `collection[key]` form. An associative collection is not indexable, therefore the order of entries does not matter: two associative collections will be equal as long as they contain the same key-value pairs, order regardless.

Collections that are neither associative nor indexable are a somewhat complex case. Sets are the only frequently used collection that is netiher associative nor indexable. They are also special because of the uniqueness constraint, that is, a set may contain each value once and only once. A set does not support the commonly used methods of access, but it does support many of the collection manipulation functions, such as `push!()` and `pop!()`. The latter, in case you were wondering, returns items in a random order, since the absence of an index means sets are not ordered. Sets are not indexable, consequently two sets that contain the same elements will be considered equal, order regardless.

In addition, collections may be _mutable_ or _non-mutable_. Put quite simply, a mutable collection is one where you can change particular values after creation, while in an immutable collection, you cannot do so. The typical immutable collections are, of course, tuples – once you have assigned a value to a tuple, you cannot change that value (although you can assign some other tuple or indeed an entirely different value to the variable that holds the tuple). Sets again represent a special case – they are what could be best described as _pseudo-immutable_ – there is no way to access values in a way that could change them, since you normally access an element of a set by its value (which is sufficient in a set thanks to the uniqueness constraint).

|:-----------:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|
|  **Indexable**      | Arrays             | Tuples            |
|  **Associative**    | Dicts              |                   |
|  **Non-indexable and non-associative**   |       | Sets      |

## Indexable collections

### Access

Elements of an indexable collection can be accessed using the square bracket notation, by their ordinal:

	julia> prime_array = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
	5-element Array{Int64,1}:
	  2
	  3
	  5
	  7
	 11

	julia> prime_array[3]
	5

In Julia, a range of numbers is written as `start:end` or `start:steps:end`. You can use a range to access a range of elements:

	julia> prime_array[2:3]
	2-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 3
	 5

 A range always returns a collection, even if it has the length 1. This is exemplified by the difference between `prime_array[3]`, the call we made above, and `prime_array[3:3]`, which returns

	julia> prime_array[3:3]
	1-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 5

	julia> prime_array[3:3] == 5
	false



You can access the last element of an indexable collection using `[end]`:

	julia> prime_array[end]
	 11

Incidentally, `end` behaves like a number – so `prime_array[end-1]` returns the penultimate element of the collection.

#### Unpacking

Indexable collections can _unpack_: that is, they can be assigned in a single line to as many distinct variables as they have elements. This is a very useful convenience feature, and is much used in functional programming:

	julia> actors = ["Ian McKellen", "Martin Freeman", "Elijah Wood"]
	3-element Array{ASCIIString,1}:
	 "Ian McKellen"
	 "Martin Freeman"
	 "Elijah Wood"

	julia> gandalf, bilbo, frodo = actors
	3-element Array{ASCIIString,1}:
	 "Ian McKellen"
	 "Martin Freeman"
	 "Elijah Wood"

	julia> gandalf
	"Ian McKellen"

Unpacking can also be used to swap the contents of variables:

	julia> firstname = "Irving"
	julia> lastname = "Washington"

	julia> firstname, lastname = lastname, firstname
	("Washington","Irving")

	julia> lastname
	"Irving"

### Common functions

#### `push!`, `pop!` and `append!`

`push!` appends the value to the end of the collection. `pop!` takes the last element of the list, returns it and removes it from the collection.

	julia> array = [1,2,3,4]
	4-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 1
	 2
	 3
	 4

	julia> push!(array, 5)
	5-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 1
	 2
	 3
	 4
	 5

	julia> pop!(array)
	5

	julia> array
	4-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 1
	 2
	 3
	 4

`append!`, somewhat unusually, puts the elements of a collection to the end of another collection:

	julia> array2 = [5,6,7]
	3-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 5
	 6
	 7

	julia> append!(array, array2)
	7-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 1
	 2
	 3
	 4
	 5
	 6
	 7


#### `shift!` and `unshift!`

Similarly to `push!`, `shift!` retrieves the first element of the collection and removes it from the collection, as one would expect looking at the function name:

	julia> shift!(array)
	1

`unshift!` is the front equivalent of `push!`, putting the second argument to the front of the collection:

	julia> unshift!(array, 8)
	7-element Array{Int64,1}:
	 8
	 2
	 3
	 4
	 5
	 6
	 7

Notice that functions ending with `!` modify the object, so, obviously, the type they act on must be mutable.

### Particular types

#### Arrays

Arrays (the ones we used in our examples so far in this section) are mutable indexable collections. The type `Array{T,N}` indicates an `N`-dimensional array which elements' types are subtypes of `T`. For instance, `Array{Number, 2}` is an 2-dimensional array. Its elements' types descend from `Number` (e.g.`Int`, `Float64`).

##### Access in multidimensional arrays

How do we access elements in a multidimensional array, a special form of indexable collection? Simple – in a multidimensional array, indexes go down each row, then from left to right. Therefore, this array

	julia> md_array = ["A" "B"; "C" "D"]
	2x2 Array{ASCIIString,2}:
	 "A"  "B"
	 "C"  "D"

would be indexed as follows:

	md_array[1] = "A"
	md_array[2] = "C"
	md_array[3] = "B"
	md_array[4] = "D"

This is a little counterintuitive and different from the usual row/column notation, where you would use `array[row][column]`. To retrieve a cell by row and column, use `array[row, column]`:

	julia> md_array[1,2]
	"B"

This generalizes for higher dimension arrays.

## Collections and types

Until now, we have generally created collections using literals, and with precious little regard to the types of information that go in them. While types will be discussed in quite a bit of detail later on, what we do know about types is that they are individual categories of data.

Julia operates what is called _type inference_: unless you tell it explicitly what type something is, it tries to figure it out best as it can. We see this in operation when we create a new collection. When a collection is created and Julia is not told that this is going to be a collection containing elements of only a particular kind or particular kinds of values, it makes an educated guess. The REPL tells us this much:

	julia> mersenne_primes = [3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, 131071]
	6-element Array{Int64,1}:
	      3
	      7
	     31
	    127
	   8191
	 131071

Upon creating the array, the REPL reports to us that it's an array consisting of six elements, all of type `Int64` – a type of signed 64-bit integer (don't worry if that means quite little to you just yet, we will be discussing various integer types in Chapter [X]). It also, helpfully, reports to us that we've got a 1-dimensional array.

### Type inference and dissimilar types

What, however, if I want to play it a little wild and mix it up? Consider the following array:

	 julia> not_really_mersenne_primes = [3, 7, "potato", 127, π, "wallaby"]
	 6-element Array{Any,1}:
	      3
	      7
	       "potato"
	      127
	      π = 3.1415926535897...
	      "wallaby"

As you have guessed, Julia is at a loss as to what to do with this, since we've got a mix of integers, strings and a constant thrown in for good measure. Therefore, it tells us that it has inferred the type of the collection to be `Any` – a type that applies to all objects.

### Type inference and empty collections

The other marginal case is that of the empty set. Julia has a dedicated type, `None` – a subtype of `Any` – that applies to the empty set:

	julia> empty_set = []
	0-element Array{None,1}
